(Data Mining Techniques Used) 

In our case, we have been instructed to use three models in implementation of our predictive models. 
The 3 selected models were: Logistic regression, Classification tree and Neural Networks. 
Among these 3 models, we are to find one as the best model and perform testing using it. 
Logistic Regression - we have used this model since it will help in estimating the probability of an individulas to donate or not to donate based on our given fundraising dataset of independent variables. The dependent variable in our case is TARGET_B and is bounded between 0 and 1.

Classification tree - A classification tree identifies what combination of our dataset factors best differentiates between individuals(donors/not donors) based on our categorical variable of interest which is (TARGET_B) 

Neural Networks - is a technique applied in our dataset in order to find hidden patterns in our fundraising dataset.
